All datasets with delay:
Delay between sampling and pulsing: 3200 [us]

Combined sequence:
20 pulses chirp
300 [us] delay
10 pulses pulsetrain

-1 in the data means that samples have been added because
of time delay between end of the pulse and start of sampling

center frequency for pulses, for all measurements: 50kHz
sampling frequency: 400kHz
